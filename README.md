# morse code:
I found the problem really interesting, the hole context made it fun to solve.
The morse codification was pretty simple and straight foward and I could have done the same for the obfuscation. But wanted to show something more interesting and thinked of buidling the map object dinmically.
The way of spliting a the code and reduce it was new to me and fun to think off how to analyze it without recurring into a loop and count.

# Flattern Array
a simple recursive solution.

# Morse code test:
added some assertion test to describe better different scenarios were the algorithim works.
